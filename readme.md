The primary objective of this analysis is to utilize the collected data to uncover significant insights that can inform HBAT's marketing strategies and operational decisions. The dataset comprises 18 variables encompassing customer demographics, performance perceptions, and outcome measures. Key areas of interest include the performance of HBAT on various attributes, overall customer satisfaction, and the likelihood of future purchases and recommendations.

In this report, we will perform a series of statistical analyses to address specific research questions and hypotheses related to HBAT's customer base:

1.  **Correlation Analysis**: We investigate the relationship between customer satisfaction and the likelihood to recommend HBAT, aiming to quantify the strength and direction of this association.

2.  **Cross-tab (Chi-square) Analysis**: We examine the association between the industry type and the distribution system used, testing the independence of these categorical variables.

3.  **Independent Samples t-test**: We assess whether there is a significant difference in the average likelihood of future purchase between customers who consider a strategic alliance/partnership with HBAT and those who do not.

4.  **ANOVA**: We explore the differences in customer satisfaction across different firm sizes, determining whether firm size significantly impacts satisfaction levels.

5.  **Bivariate Linear Regression**: We evaluate the extent to which product quality predicts customer satisfaction, providing insights into the impact of product quality on satisfaction levels.

6.  **Multiple Linear Regression**: We extend our analysis to predict customer satisfaction using multiple predictors, including product quality, technical support, and competitive pricing. This analysis aims to identify the most significant drivers of customer satisfaction.

Through these analyses, we aim to develop a deeper understanding of the factors influencing HBAT's customer satisfaction and loyalty. The findings will provide actionable insights to enhance HBAT's marketing strategies, improve customer relationships, and ultimately drive business growth.
